# Time Series Practice: Project Overview
* Using Python and Machine Learning to predict energy consumption.
* Data prep and worked with indexing as well as the datetime function in pandas.
* Plotted data according to the new datetime index so I could see when energy was being most consumed.
* Created features of different energy indicators.
* Visualized the relationships of features.
* Created Model using XGBoost.
* Created plot to show the importance of each feature.
* Created a forecast to see how the data would change over time.
